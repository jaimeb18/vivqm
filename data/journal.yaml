      My Fall 2025 semester at UF was a season of growth, uncertainty, and discovery. When I first arrived on campus, I felt intimidated by the size of the university and found myself clinging to the comfort of my own bubble. Navigating a new environment, a faster pace of life, and an unfamiliar campus felt overwhelming at times. But slowly, I began stepping into opportunities that challenged me to expand my world. Getting involved in research within the Warrington College of Business not only pushed me academically, but also helped me see how psychology, finance, and technology intersect in ways that excite me. Becoming a Network Coordinator for the Data Science and Informatics Club deepened my curiosity even more, giving me a community of students who shared similar interests and encouraged me to grow.

      Another defining part of my semester was music. Joining the Gator Band and being initiated into Tau Beta Sigma connected me to a group of people who brought energy, support, and joy into my everyday life. Through rehearsals, performances, and service events, I found a sense of belonging that reminded me why music has always been such a core part of who I am. Along the way, I met new people who became close friends, mentors, and lasting connections—relationships I might never have formed if I had stayed afraid to branch out.

      Looking back, Fall 2025 was the semester I learned to let go of fear and explore new possibilities. I pushed myself into unfamiliar spaces, embraced an entirely new lifestyle, and discovered that the moments that scared me most ended up being the ones that shaped me the most. It was a semester of transforming uncertainty into confidence and turning a huge campus into a place that now genuinely feels like home.
